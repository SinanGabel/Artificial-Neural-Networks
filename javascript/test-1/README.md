Currently there is a 2 layered neural network fully inspired by: `http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/`

# Run

Open test.html in a standard web browser, open the developer console and type, for example: 

`neuralnetwork2L(numeric.transpose(X2), Y2, 50, 10000, 0.05, 0.01)`

corresponding to: neuralnetwork2L(X, Y, hidden_units, iterations, epsilon, lambda)

It is not currently converging.
