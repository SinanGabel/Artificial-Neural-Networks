Public AI (neural network) experiments

## name inspiration, history
"Summa and its diminutive summula was a generic category of text popularized in the thirteenth century Europe. In its most simplest sense, they might be considered texts that 'sum up' knowledge in a field, such as the compendiums of theology, philosophy and canon law.". Source: wikipedia.

# About
The experiments will be inspired by the teachings of Andrew Ng and his sources. I will do my best to provide all relevant sources.

# Code
I will try to work in Javascript at first, although I know that Andrew's deep learning courses and many others work with Python (perhaps other languages). Perhaps later I will switch to Python too in this repository.
